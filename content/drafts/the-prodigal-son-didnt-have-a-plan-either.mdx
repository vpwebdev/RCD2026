<Scripture verse="When he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.' So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him." reference="Luke 15:17-20 (NIV)" />

I've read that passage maybe a hundred times. I've heard sermons on it. I've seen it on church bulletins and bookmarks and the walls of treatment centers. And for a long time, it was just a story about a kid who blew his inheritance on bad decisions and crawled back home. A morality tale. Don't be this guy.

But when you've been this guy, the passage reads different.

## The Distant Country

Luke doesn't name the country. He just says it was far. That's about right.

Addiction is a distant country. You don't go there all at once. You drift. One decision at a time, each one a little farther from home, and at some point you look around and nothing is familiar anymore. The people you're with aren't the people who love you. The things you're doing aren't the things you'd ever planned on doing. And the version of yourself that exists in this place — he's a stranger.

The prodigal "squandered his wealth in wild living." One verse. Luke covers the whole destruction in a single line. I think that's intentional. The descent doesn't need details because everyone who's lived it already knows what it looks like. It looks like losing things. One after another. Money, then relationships, then dignity, then the ability to recognize yourself.

I remember the moment I realized how far I'd gone. It wasn't dramatic. I was sitting on a mattress on the floor of a room I was renting by the week, eating cold gas station pizza at two in the afternoon on a Wednesday, and I thought, *My mother doesn't know where I am.* Not "my mother would be disappointed." She literally didn't know my address. I'd made sure of that. That's the distant country. It's wherever you are when the people who love you can't find you.

## The Pig Pen

The parable says he ended up feeding pigs. For a Jewish audience, this was the lowest possible point. Pigs were unclean. You couldn't fall further. And even the pods he was feeding the pigs — he wanted to eat those, and nobody gave him anything.

I've talked to enough people in recovery to know we all have a pig pen. The place where you finally run out of lower to go. For some people it's a jail cell. For some it's a hospital. For me it was a bathroom floor. The specifics don't matter. What matters is the sentence Luke uses next:

*When he came to his senses.*

That phrase. "Came to his senses." In Greek it literally means something like "came to himself." He woke up. He returned to who he actually was, underneath everything. And the first thing he thought about was home.

I've heard people in meetings describe their moment of clarity. It's never clean. It's not a beam of light breaking through clouds. It's more like waking up in a place you don't recognize and suddenly, for five seconds, seeing it clearly. For five seconds, the fog lifts and you think, *What am I doing? I don't belong here.*

Five seconds. That's all it takes. But you have to move in those five seconds, or the fog comes back.

## The Rehearsed Speech

This is the part that gets me. Before the prodigal goes home, he rehearses a speech. Luke 15:18-19: *"Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants."*

He practiced. He scripted it out. He knew exactly what he was going to say, probably ran through it a dozen times on the walk home. Because when you've done what he did, you don't just show up. You negotiate. You come in with the lowest possible ask, hoping it's low enough that they won't turn you away.

I did the same thing. Before I called my mom, I sat with my phone for forty minutes rehearsing what I'd say. I had a whole speech. I was going to acknowledge what I'd done, list the ways I'd failed, and then ask if she'd be willing to help me get into a program. I wasn't asking to come home. I was asking to be a hired servant. Just let me be in the vicinity of the family, even if I don't deserve a seat at the table.

Every addict I know has rehearsed a version of this speech. We practice our apologies in the mirror. We try to find the words that are honest enough to be believable but not so honest that they slam the door. We come in low because we know we don't have any right to come in at all.

## What the Father Did

This is where the parable breaks every expectation.

The son is still a long way off. He hasn't delivered his speech yet. He hasn't proven anything. He hasn't completed a program or shown six months of clean time or earned his way back into good standing. He's just walking down the road — dirty, broke, smelling like pigs.

And his father runs.

In the ancient Near East, a patriarch did not run. It was undignified. Running meant hiking up your robes, exposing your legs, looking foolish. Respectable men didn't do it. But the father doesn't walk to the gate and wait with his arms crossed. He doesn't send a servant to assess the situation. He sees his son from a distance — which means he'd been watching the road — and he runs.

He runs.

And when he gets to his son, the text says he "threw his arms around him and kissed him." The son starts his rehearsed speech: *"Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son—"*

He doesn't get to finish. The father cuts him off. Interrupts the carefully practiced negotiation. Doesn't let him get to the part about being a hired servant. Instead, he calls for the best robe. A ring. Sandals. A fattened calf. A celebration.

The son came back asking to be a servant. The father gave him back his identity.

<Scripture verse="As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us." reference="Psalm 103:12 (NIV)" />

## The Older Brother

I need to talk about the older brother because I've met him. Not in the parable — in church.

The older brother had stayed home the whole time. Did everything right. Worked the fields. Kept the rules. And when his wrecked, pig-smelling, money-wasting brother gets a party, he's furious. "I've been slaving for you," he tells the father. "And you never even gave me a young goat."

I've felt that resentment directed at me. Not from everyone. But from enough people. The long-time church members who look at the guy fresh out of treatment getting prayed over and celebrated and think, *I've been faithful for thirty years and nobody threw me a party.* They don't always say it. But you can feel it.

And I get it. I actually do. The older brother's complaint isn't irrational. Faithfulness should matter. Consistency should count. He's not wrong to feel something about the imbalance.

But the father's response is the whole gospel: "Everything I have is yours. But we had to celebrate, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found."

*Was dead and is alive.* That's not a metaphor for the prodigal. He was actually dying. The distant country was killing him. And the return isn't a reward for bad behavior — it's a rescue from death. The celebration isn't unfair. It's a funeral that turned into a homecoming.

<Scripture verse="But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us." reference="Romans 5:8 (NIV)" />

## Still a Long Way Off

The part I keep coming back to is the distance. "While he was still a long way off." The father didn't wait until the son arrived. Didn't wait until the apology was delivered. Didn't wait to see remorse or proof of change. He saw him from far away and he ran.

I think about that during Lent especially. This season of returning, of examining what we've done and where we've been. And I think about all the people who are still a long way off right now. Still in the distant country. Still feeding pigs. Still rehearsing speeches they're too scared to deliver.

The father is already watching the road. He's already looking for you. And when he sees you — not when you arrive, not when you've cleaned up, not when you've got your speech right — when he sees you, while you're still a long way off, covered in the dust and stink of wherever you've been.

He runs.
