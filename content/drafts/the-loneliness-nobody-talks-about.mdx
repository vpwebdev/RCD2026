It was a Friday night in October, maybe seven weeks clean, and I was sitting on my couch staring at a wall. Not in a meditative way. In a "what do I do now" way. My phone was on the coffee table and I'd scrolled through my contacts three times already. Every name fell into one of two categories: people I used with, or people I'd hurt badly enough that calling them at 9 PM on a Friday would've been weird at best, alarming at worst.

So I just sat there. The apartment was quiet except for the refrigerator humming. I'd turned the TV off because everything felt like noise. I ate a bowl of cereal for dinner — Raisin Bran, which felt like an insult on a Friday night — and went to bed at 10:15 because there was literally nothing else to do.

When people talk about getting sober, they talk about the cravings, the withdrawal, the white-knuckling. All of that is real. But the part that almost took me back out wasn't any of that. It was Friday night. It was the silence. It was realizing that I had built an entire social life around a substance, and when you remove the substance, you don't have a social life anymore. You have a contact list full of ghosts.

## Everyone I Knew Was Someone I Couldn't Call

This is the math of addiction nobody explains to you ahead of time. Your using friends aren't safe — being around them is a relapse waiting to happen. Your old friends, the ones from before, either gave up on you years ago or are keeping you at arm's length until they're sure you've actually changed. Your family loves you but they're exhausted, and calling your mom to say "I'm lonely" when she spent four years not sleeping because of you feels selfish in a way you can't quite articulate.

So you're alone. Not romantically — I mean existentially. You wake up alone, eat alone, spend your evenings alone. You go to meetings, and those help, but meetings end. Small group at church is Wednesday night, and that's great, but it's Tuesday and you've got the whole week stretching out in front of you like an empty parking lot.

Carlos and I used to talk about this at the halfway house. We'd be sitting on the back steps smoking — neither of us smokes anymore, but back then it was one of the few things we could still do — and he'd say, "Man, I didn't think sober would be this quiet." That's exactly right. Sober is quiet. Deafeningly quiet, at first.

<Scripture verse="Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted. Relieve the troubles of my heart and free me from my anguish." reference="Psalm 25:16-17 (NIV)" />

## Alone and Lonely Are Different

I learned this distinction from a book my counselor gave me, but I didn't really understand it until I lived it. Being alone is a circumstance. Being lonely is a condition. You can be alone and perfectly fine. You can be in a room full of people and drowning in loneliness.

I was lonely for years while I was using. Surrounded by people — parties, couches full of people, always someone to call at 2 AM. But those connections were hollow. They ran exactly as deep as the shared high and not one millimeter further. The second I was sick or broke or in trouble, those people evaporated. Because they weren't friends. They were co-conspirators.

Getting sober made the loneliness more honest, which somehow made it worse. At least when I was using, I could pretend the people around me cared. Sober, I couldn't pretend anymore. I knew the difference. I'd felt real connection — with my mom, with Ray, eventually with people at church — and that made the absence sharper. Once you've tasted the real thing, the counterfeit doesn't satisfy anymore, and the gap between what you have and what you want becomes almost unbearable.

I spent a lot of Friday nights in that gap.

## Building Something Real Is Slow and Awkward

Making sober friends as an adult is one of the most uncomfortable things I've ever done. And I've been through detox, so the bar for uncomfortable is high.

You don't know the etiquette. You don't know how to hang out without a substance as the social lubricant. The first time Marcus invited me to watch football at his place, I showed up fifteen minutes early because I didn't know what else to do, and then I stood in his kitchen holding a two-liter of Sprite like I'd never been inside someone's house before.

We watched the game. It was fine. Nobody got wasted, nobody did anything stupid, and by the fourth quarter I realized I was actually having a decent time. Not an incredible time. Not the artificial euphoria of being high with people. Just a regular, slightly boring, totally adequate time. And that felt like a miracle.

But it took months to get to that point. Months of saying yes to things that scared me. Months of small talk at church that made me want to crawl out of my skin. Months of showing up to small group and not knowing what to say and saying something anyway.

<Scripture verse="Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up." reference="Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 (NIV)" />

## The Church Didn't Fix It Overnight

I want to be honest about this because I think the church sometimes oversells itself on community. "You'll never be alone again!" Well, yes and no. Church gave me people. Real people, good people. Diane, who handed me coffee my first Sunday and never once asked me to explain myself. Terry, who invited me to a men's group where the conversations got real in a way that made me sweat but also made me feel like I was standing on solid ground for the first time.

But church is a few hours a week. The loneliness lives in the other hundred and sixty. And you can't expect a Wednesday night Bible study to fill a void that's been growing for a decade. It helps. It's essential, honestly. But it doesn't cauterize the wound. It starts to heal it, which is slower and messier.

Some Sundays I'd walk out of church feeling connected and full, and by Monday afternoon I'd be right back in it — the silence, the empty apartment, the contact list I couldn't use. Faith doesn't insulate you from loneliness. God Himself said it's not good for a person to be alone. He designed us for connection. When it's missing, we feel it. Believing in God doesn't make that ache disappear. It gives it context. And some nights, context is enough. Other nights, it isn't.

<Scripture verse="The Lord God said, 'It is not good for the man to be alone.'" reference="Genesis 2:18 (NIV)" />

## What Shifted

I can't point to a day when the loneliness lifted. It wasn't a moment. It was more like a season changing — so gradual you don't notice until you're already in it.

One night I realized I had three people I could call if things got bad. Not a lot. But three is infinity compared to zero. Marcus. Ray. A guy from small group named David who I'd started grabbing lunch with after Sunday service. None of these relationships were deep in the way my using friendships had felt deep. They were quieter, slower, built on things like showing up and telling the truth instead of shared adrenaline. But they held weight. When I leaned on them, they didn't collapse.

I still get lonely. That's the truth I'm not going to smooth over. Friday nights are better than they were, but some of them are still hard. Some evenings the apartment is too quiet and I have to call someone just to hear a voice. I'm thirty-six and I still feel like I'm learning how to be a person in the world, which is embarrassing to admit but there it is.

The difference is I don't try to fill it with something destructive anymore. I sit in it. I pray through it, badly. I text Marcus something dumb. I go to bed and try again tomorrow.

I remember the first time someone from church texted me on a random Thursday — not about church stuff, not a reminder about small group, just "Hey, you doing alright?" I stared at that text for a long time. Then I typed "Yeah, good week. Thanks for checking in." I almost added more. I didn't. But I went back the next Sunday, and the Sunday after that, and I'm still going.
