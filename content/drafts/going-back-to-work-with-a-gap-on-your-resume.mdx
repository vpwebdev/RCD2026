The conference room smelled like new carpet and burnt coffee. Third floor of an office park off Route 9, one of those buildings where every suite looks the same. I was wearing a tie I'd borrowed from Marcus because I didn't own one anymore. My resume was printed on the good paper — the heavy kind you buy at Staples when you're trying to convince someone you have your life together.

The woman across the table was friendly. Professional. She'd looked at my resume for maybe forty-five seconds before she found it. The gap. Two years and three months of nothing. Just white space between my last job and today.

"So," she said, clicking her pen. "Can you walk me through this period here?"

I had about three seconds. Maybe less. And in those three seconds, my brain ran through every option. *Health issues. Family emergency. Took time off to travel. Went back to school.* All of them technically lies. All of them easier than the truth.

I said, "I was dealing with a substance abuse issue. I went through treatment and I've been in recovery for fourteen months."

Then I just sat there.

## The Silence After

She didn't say anything right away. Maybe two seconds, but it felt like an entire season of my life. I watched her face for disgust, or pity, or the polite version of *We'll be in touch* that means you'll never hear from us again.

What she actually said was, "Okay. Thank you for being honest. Can you tell me about your experience with data entry?"

And we moved on. Just like that. Except I was sweating through Marcus's borrowed shirt and my hands were shaking under the table.

I didn't get that job. They sent the email three days later. Very polite, very corporate. I read it sitting in my car in the parking lot of the sober living house, and I wasn't even surprised. I was just tired.

## The Shame of the Blank Space

<Scripture verse="The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it." reference="Genesis 2:15 (NIV)" />

Work is woven into the beginning of things. Before the fall, before sin, before any of it went wrong — God gave Adam a job. There's something in us that needs to be useful. To build, to contribute, to come home at the end of the day having done something. When that gets taken away, or when you take it from yourself, a piece of you goes quiet.

I'd had a decent job before everything collapsed. Nothing glamorous — I was doing logistics for a distribution company. But it was steady. I had a badge with my name on it and a parking spot and a routine. Then I lost it, because that's what happens. Addiction takes the things you care about in the order you'd least expect.

The gap on my resume wasn't just a gap on paper. It was a gap in my sense of self. For two years, if someone asked what I did, I had no answer. I was in treatment, then I was in a halfway house, then I was just trying to get through the day without using. None of that fits on a resume.

Ray told me once that the gap doesn't define me. I appreciated that. But Ray doesn't have to hand his resume to a stranger and watch them do the math.

## The Job That Actually Hired Me

The fourth interview was at a cleaning company. Commercial janitorial. The owner was a guy named Dave who ran the operation out of a converted garage. He didn't ask about the gap. He asked if I could work nights and if I had a driver's license. I said yes to both.

So my first job back was mopping floors in an office building from 10 PM to 6 AM. The same kind of office building where I'd just been rejected in a conference room.

I won't pretend I was grateful from day one. I wasn't. I was embarrassed. I was thirty-four years old, mopping floors in the dark while everyone else was asleep. My mom called and asked how the job was going and I said "fine" in a voice that meant "please don't ask me anything else."

But something shifted after the first couple of weeks. It was small. I'd finish a floor and it would look clean. Genuinely clean. And there was this quiet satisfaction in that — in doing a thing and having it be visibly done. No ambiguity. The floor was dirty, now it's not.

<Scripture verse="Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving." reference="Colossians 3:23-24 (NIV)" />

That verse hit me one night around 2 AM, pushing a mop bucket down a hallway on the second floor. I'd read it before, years ago, when I had the logistics job and a badge and it was easy to work "with all your heart" because the work felt respectable. Reading it while mopping a bathroom that wasn't mine — that was different. That was the verse asking me if I meant it or if I only meant it when the work looked good on paper.

## Honesty Versus Self-Protection

I still don't know the right answer on what to say in interviews. I've talked to other guys in recovery about it and nobody agrees. Some say full honesty, every time. Some say it's none of their business and you should just say "personal health matter" and leave it at that. Some say it depends on the industry, the interviewer, the vibe in the room.

What I've landed on — and this might change — is that I tell the truth when asked directly, and I don't volunteer it when I'm not. That's not a perfect policy. It means I'm making a judgment call every time. It means I'm still, on some level, managing how people see me, which is exhausting and feels a little dishonest even when I'm being honest.

Carlos got a warehouse job and never told them anything. Worked there for eight months before someone found out and it was fine. Nobody cared. He told me I was overthinking it, and he was probably right.

<Scripture verse="Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the realm of the dead, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom." reference="Ecclesiastes 9:10 (NIV)" />

That verse from Ecclesiastes sounds bleak if you read it wrong. But I think it's actually permission. Whatever's in front of you — do that. Don't wait for the perfect opportunity or the job that matches your old life. The mop is in your hand. So mop.

## Where I Am Now

I'm not mopping floors anymore. I moved to a day shift with a different company about five months ago. It's warehouse work — packing and shipping. Not what I went to school for. Not what I imagined I'd be doing at thirty-five. My mom asked me last week if I'd thought about going back into logistics and I said I'd think about it, which is what I say when I don't want to talk about something.

The truth is I don't know what I want to do. I know I want to work. I know I want to be useful. I know that Colossians verse is true — that the work belongs to God regardless of what it looks like to everyone else. I believe that on most days.

But there are mornings I drive to the warehouse and pass the exit for the business park where I used to have the badge and the parking spot, and I feel something I can't quite name. Not regret, exactly. Something more like grief for a version of myself that didn't make it. I don't know what to do with that yet. I'm still figuring it out.

I clocked in this morning at 7:15. Punched my time card. Put on the vest. And I did the work that was in front of me, which is maybe all any of us can do. I'm trying to believe that's enough.
