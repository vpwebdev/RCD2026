I woke up without a hangover. My electricity is still on. I remembered to call my mom back. The check engine light isn't on this week. I have milk that hasn't expired. I slept in an actual bed, in an apartment with my name on the lease, and nobody's banging on the door.

That's my gratitude list from this morning. It wouldn't make a wall plaque. It wouldn't trend on social media. But every single item on it represents something I didn't have — or couldn't appreciate — a few years ago.

## The Blessed Problem

There's a version of gratitude that floats around church circles that I've never been able to connect with. The one that sounds like a bumper sticker. "Too blessed to be stressed." "Grateful, thankful, blessed." It's always accompanied by a photo of a sunset or a coffee mug, and it makes everything look curated and finished.

I don't live in that version. My life is better than it was, by a margin I can't even calculate. But it's still hard. I'm behind on one credit card. I've got a cavity I can't afford to fix yet. My relationship with my brother-in-law is cordial but there's still a wall there that I built and can't seem to dismantle. Some weeks, "better" doesn't feel like enough.

And in those weeks, someone will inevitably say, "Just focus on what you're grateful for!" Like gratitude is a toggle switch you flip and suddenly the credit card balance stops mattering.

<Scripture verse="Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus." reference="1 Thessalonians 5:18 (NIV)" />

I've wrestled with that verse. Because it doesn't say "give thanks *for* all circumstances." It says *in*. There's a difference. Paul isn't asking me to thank God for the cavity or the credit card debt. He's saying that even inside those circumstances, there's something worth thanking Him for. The trick is that finding it takes effort. Real, deliberate, sometimes annoying effort.

## Discipline, Not Feeling

Gratitude, for me, is not a feeling. It's a discipline. Like prayer, like sobriety itself. There are mornings where I sit down with my journal and write my list and I genuinely feel thankful. The sun is out, the coffee's good, something small went right the day before.

Then there are mornings where I write the list through clenched teeth. Where "I'm alive" goes on the page and my handwriting looks angry and I'm not sure I mean it. Those mornings count too. Maybe more, actually. Because gratitude that only shows up when things are good isn't really gratitude. It's just a good mood.

Ray told me early on that gratitude is one of the first things to go before a relapse. Not the last thing — the first. You stop noticing what you have. You start fixating on what you don't. The gap between where you are and where you think you should be gets louder than everything else. And in that gap, the old solutions start whispering again.

So I write the list. Even on the clenched-teeth days. Especially on those days. Not because it fixes anything, but because it keeps my eyes pointed in a direction that's harder for the enemy to exploit.

<Scripture verse="Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever." reference="Psalm 107:1 (NIV)" />

## What I'm Actually Grateful For

I'm grateful that I can feel things. That sounds weird, but I spent years chemically flatlining every emotion — good and bad. I didn't feel sadness, but I didn't feel much of anything else either. Now I feel all of it. The hard stuff hits harder. But the good stuff actually lands. My nephew's laugh. The first warm day after a long stretch of cold. A phone call with my mom where we talk about nothing for twenty minutes and it's fine. Just fine.

I'm grateful for boring days. Whole days where nothing happens. No crisis, no craving that takes over, no call from someone I owe money to. Just a regular day where I go to work and come home and cook something mediocre and watch something dumb on TV and go to bed at a reasonable hour. I used to think boring was the enemy. Turns out boring is a gift most people don't even notice they have.

I'm grateful for people who stayed. Not everyone did, and I get it. But the ones who stuck — my mom, Marcus, the handful of people from group who still check in — they didn't have to. They chose to. That's not nothing.

And I'm grateful for the hard parts, sort of. Not in a masochistic way. But in the sense that the hard parts are proof I'm actually living my life instead of numbing through it. The anxiety is real but it's mine. The financial stress is real but I'm dealing with it sober, which means I'm actually dealing with it. Even the cavity — I have a dentist now. I have a dentist and I show up to appointments. Two years ago I didn't have a dentist, a doctor, or a single professional in my life who knew my real name.

## Not a Conclusion

I don't want to tie this up neatly. Gratitude doesn't fix the circumstances. My credit card balance is the same as it was when I started writing this. The cavity still hurts when I drink cold water. My brother-in-law still keeps me at arm's length.

But I'm here for all of it. Awake, present, unmedicated. And somewhere in the tension between "my life is still hard" and "my life is still mine," there's something worth giving thanks for.

<Scripture verse="Though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls, yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will be joyful in God my Savior." reference="Habakkuk 3:17-18 (NIV)" />
