I told my sister I'd pick up her son from soccer practice at 5:15 on a Tuesday, and I showed up at 5:11.

That's it. That's the whole story. I pulled into the parking lot at the community center, parked the car, and waited four minutes until the kids came out. My nephew saw me through the fence and waved. I waved back. He got in the car and told me about how some kid named Bryson kicked the ball into his own goal. We drove to my sister's house. I dropped him off.

Nothing happened. And that was the point.

## The Speech That Doesn't Work

About six months into recovery, I sat my family down and gave what I thought was a pretty convincing speech. I'd practiced it, honestly. Mapped out the key points, included some accountability language I'd picked up from group, even quoted a verse. The whole thing lasted maybe ten minutes, and the thesis was basically: I've changed. You can trust me now.

My mom listened. My sister listened. My brother-in-law listened. And then there was this silence afterward — not the moved-to-tears kind, but the kind where people are choosing their words carefully because they don't want to be cruel.

My mom finally said, "We're proud of you, sweetheart." But I could hear the rest of the sentence she didn't say. The unspoken *but we've heard this before.*

She wasn't wrong. I'd given versions of that speech at least three times during my addiction. Different words, same promises. I'd cried real tears every time, meant it every time, and broken every promise within weeks. So when I stood there sober and clearheaded and said "this time is different," they had absolutely no reason to believe me. I'd spent years teaching them not to.

<Scripture verse="Like a broken tooth or a lame foot is reliance on the unfaithful in a time of trouble." reference="Proverbs 25:19 (NIV)" />

That verse is brutal if you're the unfaithful one. Because it means people weren't wrong to stop relying on you. You broke that tooth yourself, over and over, until they learned to chew on the other side.

## The Frustration of the Middle

I won't pretend I handled the distrust gracefully. For a while, it made me angry. I was doing everything right — meetings, therapy with Janet, daily devotions, checking in with Ray on the regular — and my family still watched me like I might detonate at any moment. My sister would glance at her purse when I walked into her kitchen. My mom would call twice if I was fifteen minutes late to anything. Not nagging calls. Scared calls.

And some selfish part of me wanted to say, "I've been sober for eight months. Isn't that enough?" Like sobriety was a down payment and trust should start accruing interest immediately.

Ray set me straight on that one, in his way. He asked me how long I'd been actively using. I said about seven years. He said, "And you want eight months to undo seven years? That's not how people work."

He was right. And the math isn't even the real issue. The real issue is that trust doesn't care about your intentions. It doesn't care about your speeches or your sincerity or how many meetings you've attended. Trust is a slow, boring, empirical process. It only responds to evidence. And the only evidence that counts is time — long stretches of time where you do what you said you'd do, over and over, without expecting applause.

## What Tuesdays Have to Do With It

Marcus told me something once that stuck. He said the word "faithful" and the word "boring" have a lot more overlap than people think.

I'd never considered that. Faithfulness sounds noble. It sounds like something from a hymn. But in practice, it's showing up at 5:11 for a 5:15 pickup. It's calling your mom on Sunday evening like you said you would. It's paying your phone bill on time. It's being where you said you'd be, when you said you'd be there, doing what you said you'd do, week after week, with no ceremony.

<Scripture verse="Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much." reference="Luke 16:10 (NIV)" />

That verse used to frustrate me because I wanted to be trusted with the big stuff immediately. I wanted my mom to stop hiding her jewelry when I came over. I wanted my sister to let me babysit without her checking in every forty-five minutes. I wanted to borrow the car without anyone tracking the mileage.

But Jesus says the path to "much" goes directly through "very little." There's no shortcut. You earn trust the same way you lost it — one decision at a time. Except earning it back takes about five times longer, because every decision is weighed against a history of broken ones.

So I started with Tuesdays. Tuesday was soccer practice pickup day. Every Tuesday, 5:15, community center parking lot. I made it the most non-negotiable thing on my calendar. Didn't matter if I was tired, if traffic was bad, if I was having a rough day. Tuesday at 5:11, I was in that parking lot.

For a while, my sister would text me at 4:30 to confirm. Then at 5:00. Then eventually she stopped texting altogether, because I'd been there fifteen Tuesdays in a row and the data was starting to stack up.

## What My Mom Taught Me About Consistency

My mom is the most consistent person I know. Four years of praying for me every morning, without a single visible result. That's faithfulness on a level I'm still trying to understand. She didn't get tired, didn't give up, didn't decide the evidence was against her and quit. She just kept showing up to that living room carpet and holding my name before God.

I think about that a lot now. Because rebuilding trust is really just learning to be consistent the way she was consistent. Not perfectly — I've been late twice and forgot to call once and had to own all three — but persistently. The kind of consistency that survives bad days and doesn't depend on momentum.

<Scripture verse="Because of the Lord's great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is his faithfulness." reference="Lamentations 3:22-23 (NIV)" />

God's faithfulness is new every morning. Not new every time He feels like it. Not new when it's convenient. Every morning. That's the standard I'm chasing — not perfection, but a relentless, boring, Tuesday-after-Tuesday kind of showing up that eventually starts to mean something.

I'm not saying I'll ever fully undo the damage. Some trust fractures leave permanent marks, and I think that's just a consequence I live with. My sister will probably always flinch a little when I'm around her valuables. My mom will probably always listen for the slight change in my voice that might signal something's wrong. Those are scars I put there, and scars don't always fade completely.

But they can stop being the dominant thing. They can become part of the landscape instead of the whole view. That takes time, though. Years, probably. More Tuesdays than I can count.

## The Key

Last month, my sister asked me to watch her house while she and her husband went to the beach for a long weekend. Feed the dog, get the mail, water the plants. Normal house-sitting stuff.

She handed me the key on Wednesday evening. Just slid it across her kitchen counter like it was nothing. Didn't attach any conditions. Didn't install a camera or ask a neighbor to check on me. Just a brass house key on a plain ring.

I stood in her kitchen holding that key and I almost cried, but I didn't, because my nephew was right there doing homework and that would've required an explanation I wasn't ready to give a nine-year-old.

It was just a key. But it was also the first time in a long time that someone handed me access to something valuable without hedging. Without a backup plan. Without the look.

I fed the dog. Got the mail. Watered the plants. Locked up when they got home Sunday night and gave the key back.

She said, "Thanks." I said, "Anytime." And I meant it in a way I couldn't have meant it three years ago. Anytime. Every Tuesday. However long it takes.
