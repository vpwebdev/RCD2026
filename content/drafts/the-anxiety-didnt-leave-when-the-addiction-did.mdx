It starts in my chest. This tightness, like someone's pressing a palm flat against my sternum. Not painful, exactly. More like a weight that showed up uninvited and won't leave. My jaw clenches before I notice it's clenching. My hands find something to do — tap the table, pick at a cuticle, spin my phone in circles on the desk. At 2 AM it's my thoughts that won't stay still, cycling through things I said six hours ago, things I need to do tomorrow, things that haven't happened yet but might, and what if they do, and what then, and what then after that.

That's anxiety. Not the word, but the actual thing. The way it lives in your body before your brain even catches up.

I thought getting sober would make it stop.

## The Volume Knob

For seven years, I had a chemical volume knob for everything I felt. Anxious? Turn it down. Sad? Turn it down. Bored, restless, overwhelmed, afraid? Down, down, down, down. I didn't realize that's what I was doing at first — I thought I was partying, or coping, or just getting through the week. But that's what it was. Emotional climate control. If I didn't like what I was feeling, I could make it quieter within an hour.

When I got clean, someone took the knob away. And everything I'd been muting for seven years came back at full volume, all at once.

The anxiety wasn't new. That's the thing I didn't understand at first. I'd had it long before I ever picked up a substance. It was there in high school — the racing heart before a test, the way I'd replay conversations in my head looking for evidence that someone was mad at me. It was there in my early twenties, before the pills, before any of it. I just didn't have a name for it then, and I found a way to make it shut up before I ever had to learn to deal with it.

So when the substances left, the anxiety didn't leave with them. It was like discovering there'd been a fire alarm going off in your house for years, and you'd been wearing earplugs. Take the earplugs out and the alarm is deafening. It was always that loud. You just couldn't hear it.

## The "Just Pray About It" Problem

About three months sober, I told someone at church I was struggling with anxiety. Constant, grinding, wake-up-at-2-AM anxiety. And they said — with genuine kindness, I want to be clear about that — "Have you tried giving it to God?"

<Scripture verse="Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." reference="Philippians 4:6-7 (NIV)" />

I love that verse. I believe that verse. But it can do real damage when it's used as a dismissal. When someone is telling you their chest is tight and their thoughts won't stop and they haven't slept well in two weeks, and the response is essentially "pray harder," something has gone sideways. It turns a medical and psychological reality into a faith failure. Like if your prayer life were strong enough, the anxiety would leave. And since it hasn't left, well, maybe you're the problem.

I spent a few months in that spiral. Praying and still anxious. Then guilty for still being anxious. Then anxious about the guilt. It's a loop that feeds itself, and it almost sent me back out, because at least when I was using, the anxiety stopped, even if everything else fell apart.

Janet was the one who interrupted the spiral. She said something I needed to hear: "Anxiety has a spiritual component and a physiological component. You wouldn't tell a diabetic to just pray about their insulin levels. Some of this is your brain chemistry. We can address that and pray at the same time."

I could've hugged her. I didn't, because that's not really our dynamic. But that sentence gave me permission to stop treating my anxiety as a spiritual deficiency and start treating it as a real condition that needed real tools.

## Both/And

I pray about my anxiety. I also go to therapy. I also exercise — three days a week, usually a run or a long walk, because something about sustained physical movement drains the nervous energy in a way that just sitting with it doesn't. I also have a prescription that I'm not ashamed of, even though there are people in my life who think medication and faith are incompatible. They're not. My blood pressure medication and my prayer life coexist just fine. The anxiety medication is no different.

This isn't a knock on prayer. Prayer does something medication can't — it orients me. It reminds me that I'm not managing this alone, that there's a God who's aware of what's happening in my chest at 2 AM. Medication doesn't give me that. But medication also does something prayer hasn't done for me yet, which is regulate the brain chemistry that keeps misfiring regardless of how surrendered I feel.

I hold both. I refuse to choose.

<Scripture verse="When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought me joy." reference="Psalm 94:19 (NIV)" />

What I notice about that psalm is the timing. It doesn't say "your consolation removed my anxiety." It says when the anxiety was great — while it was happening, in the middle of it — God's consolation brought joy. The anxiety and the consolation existed at the same time. I think that's closer to how it actually works than the version where faith makes the anxiety disappear entirely. Sometimes God doesn't remove the storm. He sits with you in it.

## What It Looks Like on a Bad Day

A bad anxiety day for me looks like this: I wake up and the tightness is already there before my feet hit the floor. I make coffee and my hands are a little shaky, not because of the caffeine but because my body decided to be in fight-or-flight before anything happened. I sit down to read my Bible and I can't focus. The words slide off. I read the same verse three times without absorbing it. I put the Bible down, pick up my phone, put my phone down, pace to the kitchen, pace back.

On a day like that, the old part of my brain — the part that remembers how effective the chemical volume knob was — gets loud. Not a craving exactly, more like a memory of relief. The body remembering what it felt like to not feel like this. That's the dangerous part. Not the anxiety itself, but the memory of how easy it was to make it stop.

What I've learned is that those days require a different playbook than the good days. Good days, I can journal and pray and go about my business. Bad days, I need to move. I need to call someone — Ray, Marcus, whoever picks up first. I need to get out of the apartment, because four walls and a racing mind are a bad combination. I need to eat something even though my stomach is in knots, because low blood sugar and anxiety are best friends.

<Scripture verse="Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you." reference="1 Peter 5:7 (NIV)" />

I used to read "cast" as a one-time action. Like you throw the anxiety at God and it stays there. But the Greek word is more like an ongoing toss. You keep casting because it keeps coming back. That reframe helped me stop feeling like a failure for having to bring the same anxiety to God every single morning. He's not annoyed. He keeps catching it.

## The Toolkit

I don't have a framework. I've been given enough frameworks to last three lifetimes. What I have is a short list of things that actually help when the chest gets tight and the thoughts start racing.

**Move.** Walk, run, do pushups in the living room, doesn't matter. Get the nervous system to discharge some of what it's holding. I keep my running shoes by the door so there's one less barrier between me and getting out.

**Call someone.** Not to solve it. Just to say it out loud. "I'm anxious today." That sentence, spoken to another human being, takes about ten percent of the power away. Sometimes more.

**Breathe on purpose.** Four counts in, hold for four, out for six. I do this in the parking lot at work sometimes before I go in. It looks ridiculous. It works.

**Pray short.** On bad days I can't do long, eloquent prayers. I can do "God, I'm here. Help." That counts. I'm convinced that counts.

**Don't make big decisions.** Anxiety lies about urgency. Everything feels like it needs to happen right now. Almost nothing actually does. I've learned to write it down, set it aside, and revisit it when the chest isn't tight.

Some mornings the anxiety wins the first hour. I'm jittery through breakfast, distracted through my quiet time, still clenching my jaw on the drive to work. But it doesn't get the whole day anymore. Most of the time. And compared to where I was — numbing everything, feeling nothing, slowly disappearing into a chemical fog — I'll take a hard morning with a clear head over an easy morning that cost me everything.
