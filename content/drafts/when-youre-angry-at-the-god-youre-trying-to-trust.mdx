I've been angry at God more times than I've thanked Him. I'm not proud of that, but I'm done pretending it isn't true.

Not irritated. Not mildly frustrated. Angry. The kind of angry where you sit in your car in the parking lot after a meeting and grip the steering wheel and say things to God that you'd never say in front of another person. The kind where you're still showing up to church on Sunday but you're furious the whole time and you don't sing and you don't care who notices.

I've been that guy. I still am, some weeks.

## What I Was Actually Angry About

It wasn't one thing. It was layers. Each one reasonable enough on its own, and stacked together they made a weight I couldn't pray my way out from under.

I was angry that I became an addict in the first place. I know the theology — free will, fallen world, the consequences of sin. I know all of it. But knowing the theology doesn't fix the part of me that wants to ask God why He wired my brain the way He did. Why some people can have two beers at a barbecue and go home and forget about it, and I couldn't stop until I was on a bathroom floor at 3 AM. That doesn't feel like free will. It feels like a loaded deck.

I was angry about the things that didn't come back. Sobriety gives you a lot, but it doesn't return everything. Some relationships stayed broken. Some bridges I burned didn't rebuild. I got clean and expected a certain amount of restoration — not all of it, but enough to make the effort feel proportional. And some of it never came.

I was angry about the time. The years I lost. You can't get those back. I can't un-miss my nephew's childhood. I can't un-break my mom's heart for those four years. Sobriety gave me my future but it couldn't give me back my past, and I resented God for that. I still do, if I'm honest. Some Tuesday mornings I'll be driving to work and I'll think about the life I could've had if I'd gotten sober at twenty-three instead of thirty-two, and the anger just sits in my chest like a fist.

## The Difference Between Angry and Gone

Janet said something in treatment that I think about all the time. She said there's a difference between being angry at God and walking away from God. They feel similar. They can look identical from the outside. But they're not the same.

Walking away is done. Walking away is "I don't believe in you, I don't need you, I'm finished." Walking away is cold.

Anger is hot. Anger is still engaged. You don't yell at someone you've given up on. You yell at someone you're still in relationship with, someone whose actions still matter to you, someone you expected something from. Anger, in a weird way, is evidence that you still care.

I think God knows the difference even when I don't.

<Scripture verse="So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak. When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob's hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man. The man said, 'Let me go, for it is daybreak.' But Jacob replied, 'I will not let you go unless you bless me.'" reference="Genesis 32:24-26 (NIV)" />

## Wrestling Is Not the Same as Leaving

Jacob wrestled with God all night. All night. And the part that wrecks me is that God didn't walk away from the fight. He stayed in it. He could've ended it in a second — He's God — but He wrestled with Jacob until daybreak.

And then He blessed him. And then He gave him a new name. And then He wrenched his hip so he'd walk with a limp for the rest of his life.

That limp is the part people skip. Jacob got the blessing and the new name, but he also got permanent damage from the encounter. He walked differently for the rest of his life. Everyone who saw him knew he'd been through something.

I don't know what to do with that except sit with it. That sometimes the encounter with God changes you in ways that hurt. That the blessing comes with a limp. That being honest with God — really, physically honest, grabbing hold and refusing to let go — might leave you walking different, and not in the way the worship songs describe.

## What My Prayers Sound Like Now

They used to be polite. Before everything fell apart, my prayers were structured and careful. I thanked God for the right things. I asked for reasonable blessings. I said amen at the end and felt like I'd completed a task.

Now they're a mess.

Some nights I sit on the edge of my bed and I don't even close my eyes. I just talk. And sometimes what comes out is gratitude, real gratitude, for the fact that I'm alive and sober and my mom answers when I call. But other times what comes out is, *Why did it have to be this hard? Why did you let me lose so much? Why are you so slow?*

I don't think God minds. I think He'd rather have my actual voice — angry, confused, ungrateful — than the polished version I used to perform. I think the polished version bored Him. At least this one is real.

Ray told me that the most dangerous prayer is no prayer. That silence between you and God is worse than screaming. I believe that. I've done both, and the silence was worse.

## The Psalm That Doesn't Resolve

<Scripture verse="You have taken from me friend and neighbor — darkness is my closest friend." reference="Psalm 88:18 (NIV)" />

Psalm 88 is the only psalm that ends in darkness. Every other lament in the Psalter — every single one — eventually turns. Eventually says "but God." Eventually finds the silver lining or the hope on the horizon or the declaration of trust. Not Psalm 88. It starts in despair and it ends in despair. The last word is darkness.

The fact that this psalm is in the Bible means something. It means God looked at this prayer — this raw, hopeless, unresolved prayer — and said, "Put it in. I want this one preserved." He didn't edit it. Didn't add a redemptive ending. Didn't tack on a verse about everything working out. He left the darkness in.

I need that psalm to exist. I need to know that there's room in Scripture for the prayer that doesn't end well. For the night that doesn't produce a morning. For the person who shows up before God with nothing but anger and grief and leaves with nothing but anger and grief, and God still considers it worship.

<Scripture verse="How long, LORD, must I call for help, but you do not listen? Or cry out to you, 'Violence!' but you do not save?" reference="Habakkuk 1:2 (NIV)" />

## Where I Am With This

I don't have a resolution. I want to be clear about that because I think too many Christian writers pretend they do. They write about anger at God in the past tense, like it's something they figured out, filed away, moved beyond. I haven't moved beyond it.

Last Thursday I was sitting in my car after a meeting, engine off, staring at the Walgreens across the street, and I was angry again. Not about anything new. About the same old things — the time, the damage, the slowness of repair. And I said to God, out loud, in an empty car, "I don't understand you. I don't understand why it had to go this way."

He didn't answer. He usually doesn't, at least not in the moment. But I showed up to church on Sunday. And I'll probably show up next Sunday too. Not because the anger has resolved. Because I don't know where else to go. Because even Jacob, hip wrecked, limping into the sunrise, wouldn't let go.

I'm still holding on. I'm still angry. I'm starting to think those two things might have to coexist for a while, and I don't know if that's faith or stubbornness or both. Most days I can't tell the difference.
