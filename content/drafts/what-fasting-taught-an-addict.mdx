What kind of person who spent a decade terrified of going without would voluntarily choose to go without?

I asked myself that when someone at church first brought up Lent. The whole concept struck me sideways. You're telling me I should give something up — on purpose, for forty days — as a spiritual exercise? My entire addiction was built on the desperate, clawing refusal to go without. Every hustle, every lie, every burned relationship was in service of one goal: never feel the absence. Never sit in the gap between craving and having. Fill it. Always fill it.

And now you want me to create a gap on purpose?

## The Difference Between Withdrawal and Fasting

I need to be clear about something, because I don't want to romanticize this. Withdrawal is not fasting. Withdrawal is your body punishing you for what you did to it. It's involuntary. It's brutal. I spent three days in a treatment center shaking so hard I couldn't hold a cup of water. Janet had to help me eat ice chips. That's not a spiritual practice. That's a medical event.

Fasting is different because fasting is chosen. That's the whole point. Nobody's forcing it. You walk up to something you want — something you're allowed to have — and you say, "Not right now." That voluntary piece changes everything.

When I was using, I had no relationship with the word "no." Not directed at myself, anyway. I could say no to people who loved me. I could say no to jobs, responsibilities, common sense. But I could never say no to the thing. Fasting is like practicing a muscle I didn't know I had. Or, more accurately, a muscle I'd let atrophy completely.

<Scripture verse="When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen." reference="Matthew 6:16-18 (NIV)" />

## What the Hunger Showed Me

My first real fast was two years ago. I skipped food for twenty-four hours. Nothing heroic — people do multi-day fasts all the time. But for me it was enormous, because around hour fourteen, sitting at my desk at work with my stomach growling, I had a thought that stopped me cold: *This is uncomfortable, but I'm not dying.*

That sounds like nothing. But my whole addiction was built on the lie that discomfort equals emergency. That any unpleasant sensation — physical, emotional, spiritual — required immediate medication. Hunger, boredom, sadness, anxiety, loneliness. Same response every time: fill it, numb it, make it stop.

Sitting in that hunger and realizing I was fine — that I could feel something I didn't like and not act on it — that rewired something in me. Not dramatically. I didn't have a vision or hear a voice. I just sat there with my growling stomach and thought, *Huh. So I can do this.*

Ray would probably say that's what surrender looks like on a Tuesday. Nothing cinematic. Just a guy at a desk, hungry, choosing to stay hungry, and discovering that the world doesn't end.

## The Fast God Actually Wants

I spent a while thinking fasting was just about food. Skip a meal, feel holy, check the box. But Isaiah wrecked that for me.

<Scripture verse="Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen: to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke? Is it not to share your food with the hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter?" reference="Isaiah 58:6-7 (NIV)" />

The fast God actually wants isn't just about what you take away from yourself. It's about what you give because of what you've taken away. You fast from food and use that time to pray. You fast from comfort and use that discomfort to remember people who don't get a choice about their discomfort. You fast from noise and sit in the silence long enough to hear something you've been drowning out.

For someone in recovery, this hits different. I spent years taking everything I could — every resource, every ounce of patience, every dollar people were willing to lend me. My whole life was consumption. Fasting flips that. It asks: what if you became someone who goes without so that someone else doesn't have to?

I'm not there yet. Not fully. But I'm closer than I was.

## What I Actually Need

There's a verse Jesus quotes when He's in the desert, forty days into His own fast, and the devil's telling Him to turn stones into bread.

<Scripture verse="Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God." reference="Matthew 4:4 (NIV)" />

I used to read that as a nice metaphor. Now I read it as a diagnostic. Because my addiction was proof that I'd been trying to live on bread alone — or whatever the equivalent was. I was feeding one hunger and starving another. Pouring everything into the body and leaving the soul completely empty.

Fasting exposed that. When I removed the physical satisfaction, what was left? What was underneath the constant filling? Turns out, a hunger I'd been ignoring for years. Not for substances. For meaning. For connection that wasn't transactional. For the sense that my life was pointed at something other than just surviving until the next hit.

I don't think everyone needs to fast to figure that out. But I did. I needed the absence to show me what was actually missing.

## This Lent

This year I'm fasting from my phone after 8 PM. That probably sounds minor compared to what some people give up. But I've noticed that my phone has become the new filler — the thing I reach for every time the silence gets too loud or the evening gets too still. It's not destroying my life the way substances did. But the reflex is the same. Discomfort, reach, numb.

So at eight o'clock I plug it in on the kitchen counter and I walk away. And the first twenty minutes are genuinely annoying. I don't know what to do with my hands. The apartment feels too quiet. I pace a little. But then it settles, and I pick up my Bible or I just sit on the couch and let the quiet be quiet.

I won't pretend it's transformative every night. Some nights it's just boring and I go to bed early. But some nights I end up in a conversation with God that I wouldn't have had if I'd been scrolling through my phone. And that's worth the forty days of mild irritation.

I think fasting, for someone like me, is really just practice at being human. Practice at sitting in the gap and not panicking. Practice at needing something and not immediately grabbing for it. Practice at trusting that God is enough, even when every nerve in my body is whispering that He isn't.

Most days, I believe He is. That's more than I could say a few years ago.
