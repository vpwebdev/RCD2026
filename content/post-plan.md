# RCD2026 Post Schedule & Content Plan

## Publishing Cadence
**2 posts per week** — Tuesday and Friday
This matches the pace established Jan–Feb 2026 (~every 3-4 days).

## Category Rotation
Rotate through all 6 categories to keep content balanced:
- **Devotion** — Morning routines, surrender, daily walks with God
- **Scripture** — Bible reading, specific passages, study methods
- **Reflection** — Personal essays, identity, grief, gratitude
- **Faith** — Theology in practice, doubt, worship, belief
- **Prayer** — How to pray, types of prayer, prayer in hard seasons
- **Community** — Church, relationships, accountability, family

## Structural Variety Rules
Based on the humanizer audit, each post should vary from its neighbors:
- Don't open 2 consecutive posts with a personal addiction scene
- Rotate closings: image, scripture, abrupt stop, question, practical step
- Limit named-character introductions to 1 per post max, no physical tags
- No more than 1 "here's the thing" or "nobody tells you" per 5 posts
- Vary scripture count and placement per post (1–4 refs, not evenly spaced)
- Vary length: most posts 7–8 min, but include occasional 5 min and 10 min
