I've spent more time doubting God than trusting Him. Way more. And I don't think that makes me a bad Christian. I think it makes me an honest one.

<Scripture verse="Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, 'I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!'" reference="Mark 9:24 (NIV)" />

## The Questions Nobody Wants You to Ask

Church isn't always great at making space for real questions. Somebody asks how you're doing and the expected answer is "Blessed" or "God is good," even when you're falling apart inside. And if you're somebody who's walked through addiction, your questions aren't the polite kind.

Mine sounded like this:

If God is good, why did He let me end up like this? Did He look away? Did He not care? If He's supposed to be all-powerful, why didn't He stop me before I wrecked everything? I wasn't asking for a miracle. Just a closed door. A flat tire. Something.

And the big one, the one I was afraid to even think: What if none of this is real, and I'm just swapping one crutch for another?

I sat with that last question for months. It scared me more than the cravings.

The worst of it was on the floor of a Quality Inn bathroom somewhere off I-40, sick from withdrawal, at about 3 in the morning. I was praying — or something like praying. More like begging. I said something along the lines of, "God, if you're real, either help me or let me die, because I can't do this anymore."

He didn't answer. Not that night, anyway. And I carried that silence around with me for a long time. It felt like proof that nobody was listening.

## The Part That Got Worse in Recovery

My doubt wasn't worst during the addiction. During the addiction I had an excuse. I was messed up, I was high, I couldn't think straight. Of course my faith was shaky. Who could blame me?

The doubt got worst in recovery. Because in recovery, you're thinking clearly. Maybe for the first time in years. And with that clarity comes a full, unfiltered view of the damage. Every person you manipulated. Every relationship you torched. Every chance you wasted. You see it all, with the volume turned up.

And you think, *Why would God want anything to do with me?*

I'd sit in church and look around at everyone singing and I'd think, *They don't know. They don't know what I've done. If they knew, they wouldn't want me here.* I felt like a fraud. I felt like the worst person in the room. I was performing faith without feeling it, and I was terrified someone would notice.

A counselor I was seeing said something I didn't want to hear: "You know what doubt actually is? It's your faith getting honest for the first time."

I hated that. But she was right.

<Scripture verse="When I am afraid, I put my trust in you." reference="Psalm 56:3 (NIV)" />

## What I Did With the Doubt

I wish I had a clean three-step process for getting through doubt. I don't. What I did was messy and took a long time.

I stopped pretending. That was step one. I stopped saying "God is good" when I wasn't sure He was. I stopped performing worship when I was angry at Him. I started being honest in my prayers, which mostly sounded like, "I don't know if you're listening. I hope you are. I'm showing up anyway."

I kept going to church. Not because I felt anything. Because my sponsor told me to and I didn't have a better plan. There were Sundays where I sat through the whole service feeling absolutely nothing. And then there were Sundays where a single line from a hymn would crack something open in my chest and I'd have to leave the room.

I read the Psalms. David was angry at God. He was confused. He was scared. He said things like, "How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever?" And somehow his complaints made it into the Bible. Which meant God wasn't afraid of complaints. He'd actually preserved them for thousands of years as if to say, *Bring it. I can handle it.*

## Where I Am Now

My faith now looks nothing like the faith I performed before everything fell apart. It's quieter. Less certain about the small stuff, more anchored in the big stuff. I still have doubts. I had one last Thursday, actually. But the difference is I don't run from them anymore. I bring them to God, and He doesn't flinch. He never has.

If He didn't leave me on that bathroom floor in the Quality Inn, He's not leaving you either.
