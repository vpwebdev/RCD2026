"Prayer isn't a performance, man. It's just talking. And He already knows the worst thing you ever did, and He's still sitting there waiting to hear from you."

A guy at my church named Terry said that to me, and something about the way he said it — like it was the most obvious thing in the world — made me actually go home and try it.

I'd been avoiding prayer for years. Not because I didn't believe in God, but because I was terrified of silence. Silence is where the guilt lives. When everything goes quiet, the memories you've been medicating come flooding back. The faces of people you hurt. The version of yourself you can't stand to look at. When you've spent years keeping the noise at maximum volume, someone telling you to "just sit still and talk to God" sounds like asking someone with a fear of heights to go skydiving.

But Terry's line stuck. So I tried it.

## The Framework That Saved My Mornings

I can't do an hour of prayer. I've tried. My brain won't cooperate. By minute eight I'm thinking about whether I left the oven on or mentally reorganizing my closet. So I came up with a five-minute version, and honestly, it works better for me than any structured prayer routine I've been taught.

**First minute: gratitude.** I thank God for one specific thing. Not "thank you for everything" — that's too vague and my brain slides right past it. Something concrete. "Thank you that I slept through the night without waking up in a sweat." "Thank you for that text from my sister." One thing.

**Second minute: the ugly stuff.** I confess something. Could be big, could be small. "I had a craving yesterday and I didn't tell anyone." "I was a jerk to the cashier at Walgreens." Whatever I've been carrying. The stuff that grows in the dark — you bring it into the light and it shrinks. Every time.

**Third minute: someone else.** I pray for one person by name. My mom. My buddy Marcus who's six months sober. A coworker who looked rough this week. Praying for other people does something strange — it pulls you out of your own head. And for addicts, getting out of your own head is half the battle.

**Fourth minute: what I need.** Not what I want. What I actually need for today. "Give me patience." "Help me not lose it when my boss does that thing." "Get me through the 3 PM window without reaching for the old solution." I try to be specific because vague prayers get vague results, at least in my experience.

**Fifth minute: shut up.** This is the hardest one. Just stop talking and sit there. Let God get a word in. I'm still not great at this part. My brain immediately starts drafting a grocery list. But I try. And sometimes — not always, but sometimes — something settles in. A word. A feeling. A quiet that doesn't feel empty.

<Scripture verse="Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God." reference="Philippians 4:6 (NIV)" />

## What Happened Over Time

The first few weeks felt like talking to the ceiling. But I kept at it, mostly because I didn't have a better option.

Around the two-month mark, I was sitting in my car after the five minutes — parked in my apartment complex, engine off, nobody around — and I noticed something. I wasn't anxious. Like, at all. For the first time in as long as I could remember, I wasn't dreading the day. I wasn't bracing for impact. I was just sitting there. OK with things.

It wasn't a dramatic heavenly moment. It was more like realizing you've been clenching your jaw for three hours and finally letting go.

<Scripture verse="The Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth." reference="Psalm 145:18 (NIV)" />

Five minutes is a starting point. Some days it turns into twenty because something hits and I can't stop. Most days it's five and done. Both count.

You don't need to sound like a pastor. You don't need King James English. Whatever's actually in your head — say that. God's been waiting for the real version of you. The polished version never fooled Him anyway.
