<Scripture verse="Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!" reference="2 Corinthians 5:17 (NIV)" />

I can quote that verse from memory. I've had it underlined in my Bible for years. But there was a stretch in early recovery where I'd read it and think, *That's nice. For other people.*

Because the verse says "new creation," and I still felt like the old one. Same face in the mirror. Same memories. Same guy who did all those things — just sober now. Sobriety didn't erase the scoreboard. If anything, it made me read it more clearly.

## The Difference Nobody Explains Well Enough

Guilt says, "I did a bad thing." Shame says, "I am bad." They sound similar but they live in completely different places. Guilt can actually be useful — it's the signal that something's wrong, the thing that drives you to confess and make amends. Shame just eats you from the inside. It doesn't motivate change. It paralyzes you.

I spent a long time not knowing the difference. I thought the sick feeling in my stomach was conviction. Turns out, most of it was shame wearing conviction's clothes. Conviction points you toward God. Shame tells you there's no point in going to Him because He already knows what you are.

I believed shame for a long time. It was easier, honestly. Shame doesn't ask anything of you. It just tells you to sit down, shut up, and accept that this is who you are. Conviction is harder because it says, "Get up. You're not done."

<Scripture verse="There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus." reference="Romans 8:1 (ESV)" />

## What Shame Sounded Like in My Head

The lies were specific. That's the thing about shame — it doesn't deal in generalizations. It keeps receipts.

*You stole from your mother. What kind of person does that?*

*You looked your girlfriend in the eye and lied. Dozens of times. Without flinching.*

*Remember the Christmas you missed? Your nephew asked where you were. They had to make something up.*

*You can go to church all you want. You know what you are.*

Those aren't abstract. Those are real things I did. And shame's trick is taking real events and drawing a permanent conclusion from them: this is your identity. Not what you did. Who you are. And once you believe that, recovery starts to feel like a costume you're wearing over the real you.

## The Day It Cracked

About eight months sober, I was in a conversation with my sponsor and I said something like, "I just don't think I'm a good person. I think I'm a bad person trying really hard to act good."

He got quiet for a second. Then he said, "So what's God supposed to do with that? You're telling the Creator of the universe that His renovation project is a lost cause?"

I didn't like that framing. But it stayed with me. Because if I really believed what Scripture says — that I'm a new creation, that the old is gone, that there's no condemnation — then clinging to shame wasn't humility. It was disagreeing with God. And when I put it that way, it sounded less like honesty and more like pride.

That didn't fix it overnight. But it planted something. The idea that maybe my identity wasn't supposed to come from my worst moments. That maybe God was building something with the wreckage and I kept wandering back to stare at the rubble instead of looking at the blueprints.

## What I'm Learning About Identity

I don't have this figured out. I want to be clear about that. There are still mornings where I wake up and the first thought is a memory I'd rather not have, and it takes effort to not let that memory define the day.

But I've started asking a different question. Instead of "Who was I?" I'm trying to ask "Who is God making me into?" Those are wildly different questions. The first one has a fixed, ugly answer. The second one is still being written.

Ephesians 2:10 says we're God's "workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand." The word "workmanship" in Greek is *poiema* — it's where we get the word "poem." God's writing something with my life. It's not the poem I would've written. It's got some rough stanzas. But it's His, and He doesn't abandon drafts.

<Scripture verse="For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do." reference="Ephesians 2:10 (NIV)" />

## The Practical Part

If shame is loud in your head right now, a couple things that have helped me:

Name it out loud to someone. Shame grows in isolation. The moment you say "I feel like a fraud" to another human being who doesn't flinch, shame loses about half its power. I've watched this happen in small groups more times than I can count.

Separate the sin from the identity. What you did was real. Confess it, make amends where you can, and let the cross do what the cross does. But don't let the enemy tattoo your worst moment onto your forehead and call it your name. That's not how God sees you. It never was.

Read Romans 8 when shame gets loud. The whole chapter. Out loud if you can. It's the best weapon I've found. Starts with "no condemnation" and ends with "nothing can separate us." There's not much room for shame between those two bookends.

Some days I believe all of that. Some days I'm back to arguing with the mirror. But the mirror days are getting less frequent, and the Romans 8 days are getting more common. I'll take that trajectory.
